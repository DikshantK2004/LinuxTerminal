list command


list command lists all the files and directories in a particular directory

Syntax: list [options].. [directories]..

both options and directories are optional

if no directory is mentioned , lists files and directories from current folder

Implemented Options:
-a -> lists hidden files (starting with .)

-r -> reverses the order of printing 

-l -> gives detailed information about the files and folders

-S -> used to sort the files and folders by size(sort while printing)
      File with higher size comes above (when -r is not used , otherwise reversed)

-t -> used to sort the files and folders by last modification time(sort while printing)
      File with  latest modification time comes above (when -r is not used , otherwise reversed)

Note:-

1.)    Options can be added anywhere as long as they are preceeded by -
        list -l -S
        list -lS
        list -l file1.txt -S
        All give the same output

2.)    Every permutation of options work
3.)    if S and t , both are present, the one which comes after takes priority
