move command

moves many source files to a destination

Syntax: move [options]..sourceDir1/source1.txt sourceDir2/source2 destination/destFile ...


not adding sourceDir1 or sourceDir2 finds files in current directory only
destFile name should only be specified if only 1 soucefile is provided
if destination is not provided, files are moved in same current working directory

if destFile is already present, it is overwritten unless options are specified otherwise creates it

Options implemented:
-i -> Shows an interactive prompt when the file is already present

-n -> If file is already present at destination, ensures that the file is not ovewritten

-u -> If file is already present at destination, overwrites 
      only if the destination file is older than sourcefile(last modification time)

-v -> prints the extra information about what the command has exactly done

Note:-

1.)    Options can be added anywhere as long as they are preceeded by -
        move -i -n
        move -in
        move -i soucefile1.txt -n
        All give the same output

2.)    Every permutation of options work
3.)    if i & n  both  are present, the one which comes after takes priority
4.)    if u is also present with n and i , u works as directed by n or i (checks for latest file)
       then guided by n or i;
5.)    Doesn't move directories.

Warning:------------------
     Please don't try to copy a file , where a folder with similar name is already present
